OBJECTIVE: Qishen Yiqi Drop Pill (QSYQ) has been recognized as a potential protective agent for various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of QSYQ in cardiac complications associated with diabetes is not clear currently. In this study, we investigate whether QSYQ could exert cardiac protective effects against high glucose-induced injuries in cardiac H9c2 cells.
METHODS: H9c2 cells were exposed to 24Â hours of high glucose in presence or absence of QSYQ and LY294002. Cell cytotoxicity, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were determined. Levels of bax, bcl-2, p53, cleaved caspase-3, PI3K and Akt were evaluated by Western blot.
RESULTS: Our data indicated that QSYQ significantly increased the cell viability and decreased cytotoxicity. By analysing the apoptotic rate as well as the expression levels of cytoapoptosis-related factors including cleaved caspase-3, bax, bcl-2, and p53, we found that QSYQ could remarkably suppress apoptosis of cardiomyoblasts caused by high glucose. In addition, it also showed that QSYQ reduced the generation of ROS. We further found that QSYQ treatment could inhibit the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and mPTP opening. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt. The specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002 not only inhibited QSYQ induced PI3K/Akt signalling pathway activation, but alleviated its protective effects.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these findings demonstrated that QSYQ effectively protected H9c2 cells against the series injuries due to high glucose at least partially by activating the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.
